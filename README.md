Yweb Personal Project


This is my personal portfolio/final project for YWeb Career Development Bootcamp Cohort 17.
I can honestly say that I have learned a lot.  I have a great deal of appreciation for the 
people that are making this opportunity a reality as well as the organization which houses this iniative.
